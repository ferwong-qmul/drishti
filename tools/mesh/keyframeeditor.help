General Help


Keyframe Editor allows users to save keyframes for creating animations.

Once saved, keyframes can be moved to change the frame number. Users can overwrite the keyframes. Select a keyframe by clicking on the keyframe image. Once selected, a keyframe can be deleted. 

Drishti Mesh interpolates the following properties between keyframes :

    * lighting information
    * model transform
    * background color
    * captions
    * camera parameters
