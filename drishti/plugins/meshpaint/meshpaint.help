 General Help
Mesh Repaint.

Allow repainting of previously generated surfaces using variety of options.

Current volume is used for colouring the surface.  Clip, crop and blend operations affect the colour application.

User can specify how much memory is available for mesh generation.  If not enough memory is available to accommodate all the required data, then the mesh will be generated in several slabs.  These slabs are then joined together to form the complete mesh.

When switched on the original surface colour will be mixed with the current colour.

depth
depth
When generating surface color in the case of "Lut Color" and "VR Lut Color", a ray is shot inside the surface to collect color samples along that ray.  These color samples are then combined to generate the surface color.  The parameter depth specifies how deep the ray can go.

The ray is always aligned with surface normal.

This ability to shoot ray into the surface gives the user a possibility to texture the surface with the inside structure - it reveals what is beneath the skin.

fillvalue
fillvalue
When volume is clipped or cropped, the region removed by this process needs to be filled with certain value (default is 0).  The value is specified by fillvalue.

greater
greater
This parameter decides what constitutes as inside and outside regions.  By default higher (greater) values are supposed to lie inside the surface and lower values outside.

look inside
look inside
When modulating surface color by ambient occlusion, a box is placed above the surface point under consideration.  Surface normal decides the direction in which the box is placed.  The parameter look inside flips this direction.
